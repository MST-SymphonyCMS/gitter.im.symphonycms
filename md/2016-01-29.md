Reflection field doesn't work when you use xml importer? Or am I wrong?

possible it’s missing a delegate

what misses a delegate?

__ __

reflection only works on a save, I can imagine xml importer doesn't do the
save but write directly to the database

not exactly

__ __

the XML has a delegate which allows extensions to run on save/create of
entries

__ __

logic is pretty much the same as the usual save/edit so it’s just about adding
the delegate and correct funciton in the Reflection field

__ __

look at
<https://github.com/jonmifsud/entry_url_field/blob/integration/extension.driver.php>
for an example

__ __

this is URL Entry which is a slight alteration on the Reflection Field and I
have those functions

Ok, these is not in reflectionfield:

    
    
        array(
          'page' => '/backend/',
          'delegate' => 'InitialiseAdminPageHead',
          'callback' => 'initializeAdmin',

I was referring to:

    
    
                array(

                    'callback' => 'compileImportFields',

If they are there make sure you are running the Integration/last version of
XML Importer

easiest way to test is by putting a var dump &amp; die in the
compileBackendFields

to see if triggers when you run the XML importer

there insert `var_dump($context);die;`

After Line 398 try to add

`$entry->commit();`

if the data is valid in the entry at that point; committing it might be
sufficient

you should be able to remove the commit

and see what’s wrong with the ‘update'

my guess is that the way it’s being updated/inserted means there is no value

can you add a field in the XML importer

__ __

yes wait a second let me explain :)

__ __

that statement is trying to do an ‘update'

__ __

when you save via front-end; the ‘field’ is saved with blank/old/dummy data

__ __

so the ‘update’ would find the wrong value and replace it

__ __

if the XML importer creates no `empty` value

__ __

there is nothing to update

__ __

so my guess is best is to add a new field in XML importer to insert some blank
data into the reflection field

__ __

you remove the commit and it should magially work

@nitriques and me are trying to fix that stuff, starting with the Hashid
Field, also discussing delegates and inner workings of the Reflection Field
and the XML Importer. So if you stay tuned, we will hopefully have something
that doesn't need any "tricks". :-)

There is one more commit in the works for the Hashid Field, btw.

But I won't make it today. If you can wait one or two days with testing… you
won't need to commit the complete entry in order to update the field's data.
