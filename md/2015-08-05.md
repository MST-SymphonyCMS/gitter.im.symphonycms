Hey guys maybe someone has already come across this issue before. When using
the ninja technique (apply templates) the html output seems to be adding
whitespace in between inline elements. client just pointed it out. Any idea
how to get around it?

@munki-boy Thanks for the precision, I'll have to check with my government
(which may take years)

__ __

@jonmifsud I ALWAYS use

__ __

    
    
    <xsl:output method="html" 
        omit-xml-declaration="yes"
        encoding="UTF-8"
        indent="no" />

which removes all non necessary white spaces

it’s not an indentation thing though :/

the "traditional" way to do it would be to set font-size: 0 and line-height:0
on the parent element

and reset font-sizes on the child

basically the html came all without whitespace except where I have the inline
stuff. I’ll try the inline block stuff

    <p>With horror, I read recently about the Lithuanian state’s attempt to hide its history of Nazi collaboration — 
                    <a  href="http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/history/2015/07/lithuania_and_nazis_the_country_wants_to_forget_its_collaborationist_past.html?wpsrc=sh_all_dt_tw_top" target="_blank" title="">by accusing Jewish partisans who fought against the Germans (and their Lithuanian collaborators) of ill-defined, ill-documented “war crimes.”</a>

__ __

it comes broken up like that, it’s not normal right? (maybe I have something
wrong somewhere)

@nitriques I think that doesn’t work for me since the issue is with likns and
paragraphs :/ issue is basically when there’s a link with a fullstop after it.
They don’t want the extra white space (important for a news provider)

Yeah I would avoid to have text child and node child under the same parent

Using strip whitespace I only get so far. I addeed “Linklovely” before and
after each &lt;a&gt; tag using the ninja technique, could the apply-templates
be adding a whitespace? database has no whitespace but the XML (debug and
debug-raw) have it

__ __

so how do you deal with markdown anchor tags?

__ __

or other inlines?

I my case, every word is always under a p, hX or ul/ol

I've never activated markdown for single line content

in a paragraph there’s text, with a link, and the link is adding whitespace
either side.

__ __

Markdown extra w smarty pants

__ __

confirmed data in DB looks valid no whitespace

__ __

it’s something with conversion to XML/XSLT

that's really weird

could you try another formatter, just to be sure (and re-save then entry)

hmm will try - though doubt it will do anything. if just fetches from the DB

__ __

I was going to see if I can get the XML/parser to remove whitespace not sure
if that would have an impact

__ __

weird editing xmlelement-&gt;generate to force indent to false seems to
‘solve’ the issue

__ __

not great for debugging though

no def not same server. Running one on ngnix one on apache

__ __

I don’t think an extension would be adding white space around the a tags…
can’t think of one but will look around.

I'm late to the party again, does anyone know a good solution for importing
local content. Like the old CSV importer. I might have to port product data
into entries.
