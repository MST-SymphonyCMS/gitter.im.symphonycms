Hey Symphonists, we are currently updating a few very old client sites that
still relied on PHP 5.2. Are there any updates on when Symphony will be
officially PHP 7 compatible?

@nilshoerrmann there’s a dialogue with @nitriques on this topic further up

__ __

Basicly `Symphony 2.7 beta` works with PHP7 and a lot of extensions already
have forks or branches with support already. Most problems that turn up with
extensions actually come with an error message telling you exactly how to fix
them `:)`

__ __

Apart from that most hosts still support 5.6

I know that, but some host are pushing to PHP 7 aggressively (which is not a
bad thing in my eyes) and Symphony isn't well prepared for that.

Is there an ETA for Symphony 2.7?

Since Nicolas has just become parent I’m not sure if it’s estimateable
currently …

Oh, cool, I missed that! (Concrats, @nitriques!)

__ __

So I guess that also means Nicolas is the only left active core developer,
right?
