I’ve read it can be changed with the `FrontendPreRenderHeaders` delegate. But
I have not the faintest idea how to apply that to a page. :baby_symbol:

  2. Write an extension
  3. Overwrite the header in the webserver

This is what I have at the top of my `.htaccess` for one of my Symphony sites
`Header always set X-Frame-Options "ALLOW-FROM http://www.example.com/foo"` \-
it is to allow that Symphony site to be in an `iframe` at
`http://www.example.com/foo`

In nginx you can do a lot of stuff based on "locations" (which may be a
"directory" or a single page). In Apache you can do what @cylkee says. You may
wrap it in a condition like so:

__ __

    
    
    <IfModule mod_headers.c>
        Header set X-Greeting "Hello"
    </IfModule>

__ __

I am not sure how to limit this to a single page, but Google may know. :-)

That mini extension sounds interesting. I guess it is also possible to set a
404 header?

404 I’d presume - but I use datasources to throw 404’s most of the time

Yup but I've got a one page approach and for a client with specific needs I
can't use the datasources for the 404

I’d use a datasource check what I need and manually throw a 404 in there; so
it uses the right templat

Do you really need to remove the `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` header? What
about `Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *`? Wouldn't this work fine as well?

that would work too; I had given him something I had which just removed the
header but maybe providing the right header is more syntactically correct

Appending. You remove two headers, then you add the same headers with
different values.

__ __

Like so:

__ __

    
    
    $frontendPage->removeHeaderFromPage('X-Frame-Options');
    $frontendPage->removeHeaderFromPage('Access-Control-Allow-Origin');
    $frontendPage->addHeaderToPage('X-Frame-Options','ALLOWALL');
    $frontendPage->addHeaderToPage('Access-Control-Allow-Origin','*');
