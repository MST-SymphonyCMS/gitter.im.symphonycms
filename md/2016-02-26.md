Is it doable to serve some specific pages from a website with another
domainname without to much hassle?

A client have a product catalog with several brands and like to serve two
brands with an own domainname and own design but without building seperate
websites. As always budget is low.

yes possible

__ __

will the website have the same structure?

__ __

If yes you can use a url-param to switch ‘themes/branding'

then just modify the htaccess redirects to add the ?url-brand

to symphony

__ __

then using that switch css/branding

yeah you’d just have a modification on the symphony internal redirect in
htaccess

then you can run as many domains as needed

Ok, and otherwise I could use the same database and a seperate installation

you could use same symphony

__ __

and different pages/datasources

__ __

but if too different I would probably recommend splitting

if just a layout go for different XSLT templates also doable as I mentioned

if you care only about one domain I would suggest doing a ‘canonical’ link to
the main site.

__ __

that would mean that the secondary sites won’t turn up in google and any link
juice is passed to the main site

ahh

__ __

no-index on each html page

__ __

and maybe you want to put a no-index / block in robots.txt

are the products of the same company?

__ __

or is it ‘stolen’ from another supplier and sold without consent. If the
former I would suggest a canonical link. If the latter robots / no-index is
your best bet.

but certain services can and will ignore it especially if looking for
copyright &amp; other legal infringements.

I would suggest a canonical if they want to point to a main brand

so any links to the ‘secondary’ brand/product

would go to the main one which they want to brand/sell

first inform the client and making a quote

Options +FollowSymlinks -Indexes

this is causing the issue

that or something relating to taht.

@jonmifsud remember you helped me with the date range filter problem some time
ago?

__ __

Actually there was yet another problem with it,

__ __

But I could fix it.

__ __

`first day of next month` actually counts all dates from the current time

__ __

e. g. if it’s 9 o’clock only dates from the first day of the next month
**after 9:00** will be shown

__ __

THIS IS SO BLOODY UNINTUITIVE!

__ __

Argh!

__ __

But I’m happy it works now. Wouldn’t have gotten it right without your help.
So – many thanks again!

__ __

The winner is `first day of next month 00:00 to last day of next month 23:59`

Ideally this is something that the developer of the ensemble should do. But
it's the same as with extensions: Not everybody feels obliged to also maintain
s.th. that gets released.
