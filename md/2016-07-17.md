No plans to do this @reygoch

One possible change would be pages -&gt; views

I'm trying to learn how to set up an output parameter from my datasource.
Could anyone please help me out?

__ __

I am using the Remote Datasource plugin to fetch some XML

__ __

That is working well

__ __

The XML contains a list of products with product slugs and product ids as
child nodes

__ __

Currently I have a page that uses the product id from the url parameter to
select one of the child nodes and show just that product info

__ __

but I want to have it also work to specify a product slug instead of an id

__ __

so basically I want the logic to switch depending on if the parameter is a
number or a string

__ __

my thought was to try and use output parameters to lookup a node by "slug"
name and if it fails look up by id

__ __

Is that too complicated an approach for this? Is there a better way to branch
that logic?

You need the id as output paean from the xml?

Yeah that was my thought

__ __

So I tried to make an output parameter like this xpath:
/data/catalog/products/product/entity_id[text()={$p4}]/../entity_id/text()

__ __

where $p4 is the param that contains the product slug

__ __

but I'm not sure if it is possible to use a param in the output parameter
xpath??

Yes possible but you need to customise your data source

__ __

And your xpath would be on the result set had discussed this concept before
but never sent in a pull request

ok, so my xpath shouldn't contain the /data part? probably just from /products
since the catalog is the data source?

__ __

is the customization of the data source this thing that is listed in the docs?

__ __

/code $this-&gt;_dependencies = array('$ds-primary');

__ __

`$this->_dependencies = array('$ds-primary');`

no it's a bit more complex than that... I'm on my phone I might have an
example

But will need some time

Okay. Thanks. I can wait, I'll keep trying to figure it out.

okay, I think I basically got something working by adding one line to the
processOutputParameters method of the RemoteDatasource class:

__ __

`$expression = $this->__processParametersInString(stripslashes($expression),
$this->_env);`

__ __

that seems to work to replace the {$param} values in the output param xpaths

__ __

Not sure if that is useful to other people to merit a pull request or if it
introduces any problems
